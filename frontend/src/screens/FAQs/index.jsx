					The Islamic religion views death as a transition to another state of
					existence called the afterlife. Where you go in the afterlife depends
					on how well you followed Islamic religious codes during your life.
					Muslims, practitioners of the Islamic faith, believe that if you lived
					a good life, you will go to Paradise after you die. If not, you will
					be separated from all that is good in the world. Therefore, Islamic
					funerals serve not only to comfort the grieving, but also to pray to
					Allah, the Islamic word for God, to have mercy on the deceased.

					What is Islamic Funeral Rites and Traditions?
				</h1>
				<p>
					One very important funeral rite in the Islamic faith is that burial
					take place as quickly as possible after death. For this reason, there
					is no viewing, wake, or visitation. Immediately after death, the body
					is washed and covered with a sheet by family members. The hands are
					placed as if in prayer. Then the body is transported to the location
					of the funeral, a mosque. There is rarely an open casket at an Islamic
					funeral.
				</p>
				<p>
					The funeral is typically held outside the mosque, in a location such
					as a prayer room, community square, or courtyard, where members of the
					community may gather. The body and all attendees are all turned to
					face Mecca, which is the holy center of Islam. Funeral prayers are led
					by the Imam, the holy leader. Attendees form at least three lines:
					men, then children, and women in the back. After prayers, the body is
					taken to the burial site in a silent procession. Some Muslim
					communities allow women and children to attend the burial, but
					traditionally it's just men. Another important Islamic burial rite is
					to have each person at the burial throw three handfuls of dirt into
					the grave.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since Muslims believe there will be a physical resurrection of the
					body on Judgement Day, the faith prohibits cremation. Similarly,
					autopsies are strongly discouraged, since they delay burial and are
					considered a desecration of the body. Also, Muslims prefer not to move
					the body away from the site of death, making an autopsy even more
					unsettling for them. Embalming, considered yet another desecration of
					the body, is performed only if required by law.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, tradition dictates that flowers are to be sent to the
					family's home after the burial of the deceased. There is a 40-day
					mourning period, during which time not only flowers but also food is
					appreciated.

				<h1 className='text-xl'>What is Islamic Funeral Etiquette?</h1>
				<p>
					Mourners at an Islamic funeral may express grief, but only within
					certain standards of decorum. Loud wailing, for example, is not
					permitted. Neither are other outward signs of extreme emotion, such as
					ripping of clothes, thrashing about, sacrilegious speech, and
					self-injury. Crying is permitted.
				</p>
				<p>
					Traditional Muslim funeral etiquette forbids mourners from taking
					pictures or in any other way recording any part of the funeral prayer
					service.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the prayer service and the burial, mourners may gather at the
					home of the immediate family. This is when it is appropriate to
					express your condolences to the family and support them in their
					grief. Plan to stay the entire day. Traditionally, a meal is served.
					Socializing is believed to help the family cope with their loss.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the first three days of the 40-day period of mourning,
					community members should bring food to the family. Many modern Muslim
					communities observe a shortened mourning period.
				</p>
				<p>
					Widows will customarily observe an even longer time of mourning.
					Whatever the time frame, it's important that the community visits and
					offers to help in any way they can.

				<h1 className='text-xl'>What is an Islamic Funeral?</h1>
				<p>
					An Islamic funeral is considered a community event. Muslims believe a
					funeral to be a very spiritual occasion. Everyone in attendance
					participates in group prayers, in which mourners pray that Allah will
					have mercy on not only the deceased but also on all deceased Muslims.
				</p>
				<p>
					Islamic funerals are to help mourners cope with their grief, but are
					also meant to offer hope for a good afterlife for the deceased. The
					service lasts 30 to 60 minutes.
				</p>

				<h1 className='text-xl'>What to do before imminent death?</h1>
				<p>
					Family members of the dying person and their most pious friends should
					be present at their side to help turn the final thoughts to Allah,
					reminding him or her of all the good deeds they did, about Allah’s
					mercy, and Allah’s favors. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: “Let no
					Muslim die except expecting and hoping the best from Allah” (Muslim).
				</p>
				<p>
					Family members and friends can advise the dying person very gently
					(encouragement without insistence) to say the shahada: “La Illaha
					illallah”, which means there is no God but Allah, in a very kind and
					sincere manner as these may be their last words. Abu Saeed Al-Khuduri
					reported that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: “Help Muslims who are
					dying to say “La Illaha illallah” (Muslim).
				</p>
				<p>
					Family members should make Dua (supplication) to Allah to help make
					the final moments easy, and to forgive them.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className='w-[70%] bg-green-700 flex flex-col gap-3 p-3 text-left'>
				<h1 className='text-xl'>What to do after death?</h1>
				<p>
					Immediately after the death has occurred and it has been verified,
					close the eyes of the deceased eyes; the mouth and jaws are held
					gently with broad bands or pieces of cloth so that they do not remain
					wide open; the legs should be held in the same way. The body should be
					covered, and must always remain covered, preferably with a white sheet
					of cloth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Invoke Allah and say: “Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un” (To Allah
					we belong and to Him is our return).
				</p>
				<p>
					Crying with no wailing is permitted. The prophet (pbuh) wept on the
					death of his son, Ibrahim and said: “The eyes shed tears and the heart
					feels pain, but we utter only what pleases our Lord. O Ibrahim! We are
					aggrieved at your demise.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Contact AlFirdous Funeral Services’s funeral Director for funeral
					arrangements without delay; Relatives and friends should be notified.
					The body must not be kept waiting unnecessarily. Immediate family and
					friends are to prepare food for the bereaved family for three days
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className='w-[70%] bg-black flex flex-col gap-3 p-3 text-left'>
				<h1 className='text-xl'>What information you’ll need?</h1>
				<p>
					Determine if the dying person has any preferences for people who will
					carry out the Ghusl (washing) and Kafan (burial cloth). If there is
					none, then the next of male kin to males, and next of female kin to
					females should be available to perform the Ghusl.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also when you talk to the funeral director, please prepare the
					following information for the dying person to facilitate the process
					and help in finalizing the paperwork:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ul className='list-disc pl-5'>
						<li>Current location of Deceased</li>
						<li>Social Security Number</li>
						<li>Address</li>
						<li>Date of Birth</li>
						<li>Date and Time of Death</li>
						<li>Phone Number</li>
						<li>eMail</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					If the death occurred over the weekend, most cemetery and related
					offices are open only during weekdays and for a few hours on Saturday.
					Furthermore, the cemetery does not typically open graves and allow
					burials on Sundays. As such, in the event of death on Saturday, the
					burial may have to wait until Monday afternoon.
				</p>
				<p>
					It typically takes about 3 to 6 hours to make all the arrangements at
					a minimum (Open/Close the grave, arrange the transportation, set
					prayer area). As such, a person can be buried on the same day if the
					death occurred prior to 8 AM. If the death occurred after that time,
					the arrangements will be typically made for burial the next day.
				</p>
				<p>
					Typically the Janaza prayer is performed right after the Dhuhr prayer
					(12:30 PM in winter months or 1:30 PM during daylight savings time) On
					Friday’s Janaza prayer is always after 2nd Juma prayer at Islamic
					Foundation. The Ghusl is typically performed before the Janaza prayers
					(around 10 AM or 11 Noon).

				<h1 className='text-xl'>Is Organ Donation permitted Islam?</h1>
				<p>
					Organ donation is generally acceptable for Muslims, as it follows the
					Qur’an’s teaching that "Whosoever saves the life of one person it
					would be as if he saved the life of all mankind." If there is any
					question as to whether or not organs may be donated, it is best to
					consult with an imam (religious leader) or Muslim funeral director

				<h1 className='text-xl'>Is Autopsies permitted Islam? </h1>
				<p>
					Routine autopsies are not acceptable in Islam as they are seen as a
					desecration of the body. In most cases, the family of the deceased may
					refuse to have a routine autopsy performed.
				</p>
				<hr className='w-[280px] h-[1px] mx-auto my-4 bg-gray-100 border-0 rounded md:my-10'></hr>
				<h1 className='text-xl'>Embalming </h1>
				<p>
					Embalming and cosmetology are not allowed unless required by state or
					federal law. Because of the prohibition on embalming and the urgency
					with which the body must be buried, it is not possible to transport
					the body from one country to another. Many Muslims living in America
					have a desire to be buried in the country of their ancestry, and this
					cultural practice, while acceptable in some communities, is in
					conflict with shariah. An imam or Muslim funeral director should be
					consulted if there are any questions on the matter.{' '}

				<h1 className='text-xl'>WHAT HAPPENS AT A MUSLIM FUNERAL SERVICE?</h1>
				<p>
					What happens at a Muslim funeral service is usually ruled by
					traditions of the Islamic faith. Family and friends of the deceased
					will gather in the prayer room, study room or courtyard of the mosque
					to perform Salat al-Janazah (funeral prayers). Every male must
					participate in the Salat-al-Janazah, but women may only participate if
					they are willing to do so. The final prayer is offered from the family
					and community to ask for forgiveness of the deceased.
				</p>
				<p>
					The funeral service is led by an Imam (Islamic leader) and includes
					readings from the Quran. If you are of a different faith, you are
					encouraged to quietly listen to the readings and prayers.

				<h1 className='text-xl'>WHAT HAPPENS AT A MUSLIM BURIAL?</h1>
				<p>
					Following on from a Muslim funeral service, the deceased is taken to
					the cemetery for burial. Traditionally, only men are allowed to attend
					the burial, though some Muslim communities may allow women to attend.
				</p>
				<p>
					The grave should be at right angles to the direction of Mecca, with
					the deceased placed on their right side facing the Islamic holy city.
					Wood and stones should be placed on top of the body to prevent direct
					contact between the person and the soil. All mourners will pour
					handfuls of earth on top of the grave, before it is filled in.
				</p>
				<p>Due to religious beliefs, cremation is prohibited for Muslims.</p>

					WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A MUSLIM FUNERAL SERVICE?
				</h1>
				<p>
					Like the ceremony itself, what happens after a Muslim funeral service
					is dictated by the Islamic faith, and the family's wishes. After a
					Muslim funeral service and burial, family will typically gather in
					their home and receive guests. During the first three days of
					mourning, the community usually provides food for the family. Mourning
					typically lasts for 40 days but can vary depending on the family.
				</p>
				<p>
					A Muslim widow is allowed 4 months and 10 days of mourning, during
					which she is not permitted to re-marry or interact with other men.
					This tradition is to rule out whether she is pregnant, as well as give
					her time to come to terms with the loss.

					Cremation is forbidden in the Islamic religion. It is considered
					disrespectful to the dead. A Muslim should not burn anyone, witness a
					cremation, or approve of it in any way.{' '}

				<h1 className='text-xl'>What is the Procedure For Muslim Burial?</h1>
				<p>
					The following is a typical procedure for a burial without a casket.
					Where a casket is used either because of local laws or other reasons,
					the concrete box (or the grave-liner) mentioned below is omitted and
					soil is poured directly on top of the casket:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ol className='list-decimal pl-5'>
						<li>
							The shrouded body is picked from the casket and is then gently
							lowered in the grave by two or more people. It is preferable that
							close relatives or friends perform this last service for the
							deceased.
						</li>
						<li>
							The body is received by two or more persons standing strategically
							inside the grave and is placed on the ground by them. The face of
							the deceased is then turned gently towards the Qiblah. This can
							often be facilitated by turning the whole body slightly on its
							side and strategically placing lumps of clay or earth at its back.
						</li>
						<li>
							A rectangular, concrete, lid-less box (i.e., a grave-liner)
							provided by the cemetery is then placed inverted over the body so
							as to enclose it completely. This prevents the soil from being
							thrown directly on top of the body.
						</li>
						<li>
							Everyone present may then deposit three handfuls of soil in the
							grave in accordance with the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (pbuh) as
							well as in recognition of their own mortality and of the fact that
							they too will eventually need similar services from the community.{' '}
							<br />
							<b>Abu Hurayrah (ra) reported:</b> <br />" Allah's Messenger
							(pbuh) once prayed over a Janazah, and then (after burial) he went
							toward the dead person and threw three handfuls (of soil) on the
							side of his head." (See Note #2 below). (Ibn Majah) It may be
							mentioned that there is no authentic Hadith of the Holy Prophet
							(pbuh) requiring the recital of a specific Quranic verse with each
							handful of soil.
						</li>
						<li>
							Soil is now poured into the grave to fill it completely. No
							flowers, wreaths, or similar offerings are placed on the grave. It
							is acceptable for the top of the grave to be raised slightly above
							the ground. A headstone or a suitable simple marker may also be
							placed on the grave for purposes of identification.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Notes:</h3>
					<p>
						<ol className='list-decimal pl-5'>
							<li>
								The body of a female should be handled only by those who are her
								Mahram so that her privacy is respected at all times. If no
								Mahram is present at the funeral, this service can be performed
								by close relatives or others with due regard to the deceased
								person's privacy and the sensitivity of the occasion.
							</li>
							<li>
								The person mentioned in this Hadith was buried in a Lahd type
								grave so that the handfuls of soil could be thrown towards the
								head of the body. A Shaqq type grave is in common use in the
								West so that the handfuls of soil can be thrown directly on the
								casket or the concrete grave-liner.
							</li>
						</ol>

                What is the dress code for an Islamic funeral?
				</h1>
				<p>For both men and women, dress should be modest. Men should wear a shirt and trousers. Women must wear a headscarf, plus an ankle-length skirt and a shirt with long sleeves and a high neck. Everyone should wear clean socks, as the shoes are removed before prayer. </p>
