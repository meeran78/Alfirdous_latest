            <p className="leading-10">For thousands of years, burial has been a traditional means of caring for the physical remains of a loved one. Historical precedence is one thing, but for you, burial may simply be the tradition of your family.</p>

            <h1 className='text-xl'>Traditional Service</h1>
            <p className="leading-6 text-left">There are several distinct parts, some of which are optional. The first part is called a visitation. A visitation is typically held the afternoon or evening before the funeral service. The visitation typically lasts about three hours, with people coming at the time best for them.</p>
            <p>The second part is the funeral service itself. At a funeral service, the body is present in either a closed or open casket. Funerals can be held at a place of worship or another facility.</p>

            <h1 className='text-xl'>Graveside Service</h1>
            <p className="leading-6 text-left">Following the funeral is the graveside service. Often there will be a funeral procession from the place of the funeral to the cemetery. The family can choose to use limousines, a flower car, escorts and the funeral coach (hearse). Attendees will follow behind the funeral coach on the way to the cemetery. A simpler version of this is to simply set a time to meet at the cemetery for the interment.
            Some of the necessary decisions for a funeral and burial:</p>
